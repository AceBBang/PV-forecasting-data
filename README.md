# PV-forecasting-data

There are the meteorological data and power generation data of one PV power station used in Ultra-short-term Forecasting of Photovoltaic Power via RBF Neural Network. 

Each column of the xls file denotes different type of data as the following table.

| column | type of data |
|--|--|
| 1 | time(28 denotes 7:00, 75 denotes 18:45) |
| 2 | predicted irradience of current time(not use) |
| 3 | wind speed |
| 4 | wind direction |
| 5 | temperature |
| 6 | pressure |
| 7 | humidity |
| 8 | irradience |
| 9 | current PV power output |
| 10 | PV power output before 15 mins |
| 11 | PV power output before 30 mins |
| 12 | PV power output before 45 mins |
| 13 | PV power output before 60 mins |
| 14 | PV power output before 75 mins |
| 15 | PV power output before 80 mins |
| 16 | PV power output before 95 mins |
| 17 | PV power output before 120 mins |
| 18 | PV power output before 135 mins |
| 19 | PV power output before 150 mins |
| 20 | PV power output after 15 mins (the output to be predicted) |
