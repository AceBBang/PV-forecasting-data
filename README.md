# PV-forecasting-data

There are the meteorological data and power generation data of one PV power station used in Ultra-short-term Forecasting of Photovoltaic Power via RBF Neural Network. 

Meteorological data and power generation data of one PV power station in China from 2017 to 2018 are measured at 15-min intervals. 

The data at night and invalid data are excluded. 

Finally, more than 20,000 sets of data are obtained.

Each column of the xls file denotes different type of data as the following table.

| column | type of data |
|--|--|
| 1 | time(28 denotes 7:00, and 75 denotes 18:45, because night time data are excluded) |
| 2 | predicted solar irradience(invalid) |
| 3 | wind speed |
| 4 | wind direction |
| 5 | ambient temperature |
| 6 | pressure |
| 7 | humidity |
| 8 | solar irradience |
| 9 | PV power output |
